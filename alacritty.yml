#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative

  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.

  # Cursor style
  style:
    # Cursor shape
    #
    # Values for `shape`:
    #   - ▇ Block
    #   - _ Underline
    #   - | Beam
    shape: Block

    # Cursor blinking state
    #
    # Values for `blinking`:
    #   - Never: Prevent the cursor from ever blinking
    #   - Off: Disable blinking by default
    #   - On: Enable blinking by default
    #   - Always: Force the cursor to always blink
    blinking: Off


  # If this is `true`, the cursor will be rendered as a hollow box when the
  # window is not focused.

  # from `0.0` to `1.0`.

# Live config reload (changes require restart)

# Startup directory
#
# Directory the shell is started in. If this is unset, or `None`, the working
# directory of the parent process will be used.

mouse:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
  # alacritty should wait for accepting multiple clicks as one double
  # or triple click.

  triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
  hide_when_typing: true

# Mouse bindings
#
# Mouse bindings are specified as a list of objects, much like the key
# bindings further below.
#
# To trigger mouse bindings when an application running within Alacritty
# captures the mouse, the `Shift` modifier is automatically added as a
# requirement.
#
# Each mouse binding will specify a:
#
# - `mouse`:
#
#   - Middle
#   - Left
#   - Right
#   - Numeric identifier such as `5`
#
# - `action` (see key bindings for actions not exclusive to mouse mode)
#
# - Mouse exclusive actions:
#
#   - ExpandSelection
#       Expand the selection to the current mouse cursor location.
#
# And optionally:
#
# - `mods` (see key bindings)
mouse_bindings:
  - { mouse: Right,                 action: ExpandSelection }
  - { mouse: Right,  mods: Control, action: ExpandSelection }
  - { mouse: Middle, mode: ~Vi,     action: PasteSelection  }
